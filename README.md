Support multiple clothes. Consider which resolution is the best option for your game performance.

### NOTE
If you rotate or scale 2d cloth, note that they will apply original values to the cloth and automatically update the rotation & scale in the editor to default at runtime(play mode).

The original values(rotation, scale) in the editor which you modified will be restored once you quit play mode.
